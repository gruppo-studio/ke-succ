 * Determines how many records of a group are included in the search results.  Records with the same value for the `attributeForDistinct` attribute are considered a group. The `distinct` setting controls how many members of the group are returned. This is useful for [deduplication and grouping](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/refine-results/grouping/#introducing-algolias-distinct-feature).  The `distinct` setting is ignored if `attributeForDistinct` is not set.
